# ☕ Café Order Tracking App

## 📦 Overview

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application built to help a pop-up café manage its daily operations. The café, located in a busy business district, serves homemade lunches and refreshments and needs a tool to log, track, and manage:

* Product inventory
* Courier services
* Customer orders
* Order statuses (e.g., preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered)

The app uses terminal-based menus for interaction and stores data reliably using files and databases.
